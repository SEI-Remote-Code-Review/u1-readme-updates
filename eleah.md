## [Play Rainbow Words](https://rainbowwords.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

Rainbow Words was created due to the lack of LGBT game content and to promote LGBT visibility.  The gameplay is as follows:

* The player is given a board of letters and a list of words to find.
* The player has 40 clicks to find all the words.
* As the player finds each word, the word is crossed off from the list.
* The player wins a gold trophy if all the words are found in 35 turns, a silver trophy if all the words are found in 36 turns, or a bronze trophy if all the words are found in 37-40 turns.
* "Born This Way" by Lady Gaga is played.
* If the player does not find all the words in 40 turns, the player loses the game.  The player wins a photograph of trophies.
* "Photograph" by Nickelback is played.
* The player can press play again to reset.
* Planning materials can be found [here](./pseudo.txt).
