I was inspired to create this game by playing chess puzzles with my coffee every morning.  You can find the app I use [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.lrstudios.android.chess_problems).


## Technologies used:

1. VS Code
2. JavaScript
3. CSS
4. HTML
5. Git
6. Gimp

## Credits:

Image assets (chess pieces) were acquired from [here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PNG_chess_pieces/Standard_transparent).

## Icebox (future plans):

1. Introduce other chess pieces (knights and pawns).
2. Create more puzzles.
3. Add textures to the board and background.
4. Implement stalemate logic.
5. Implement puzzles with solutions that require two moves.
