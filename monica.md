I was taught this card game on the Annapurna trail by a local Nepali guide and want to share this fun and easy game with the masses! 

## Getting Started

### General Game Play

* Each player is dealt 5 cards at the start of each new game and round.
* Player 1 must discard one of the following options:
  * 1 card, 
  * Or a 'License' enabling discard:
    * 2-4 cards if 2/3/4-of-a-kind is present
    * 3-5 cards of the same suit sequence
* Player 1 then picks up 1 card from the deck or opponent's discard pile if 'License' is enabled.
* Player 1's turn is over.
* Play moves to Player 2 to repeat .the Discard & Pick Up steps.

### How to Win

* At the start of a player's turn, if the total value of a hand is less than or equal to 5, then the player can 'Compare Hands' to end the round.
* The game will continue for multiple rounds until a player reaches 100+ penalized points.
* The player with the least amount of points wins the game.
