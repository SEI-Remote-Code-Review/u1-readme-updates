## Motivation:

I played Snake as a child. I find it reminiscent of a simpler time in my life filled with joy. The movie *Shrek* shares a similar place in my heart, so the two seemed a perfect match. It was a pleasure getting to use my newly acquired skills in software engineering to share some of that nostalgia with you.
